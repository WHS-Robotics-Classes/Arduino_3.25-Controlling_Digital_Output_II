Second try for this one

### Step One: Build the Prototype

To begin, build this prototype on your breadboard (Instead of connecting the power wires for each circuit to the 5V pin, connect them to pins 7 and 8 as the diagram describes):

After you have completed the prototype you can test your circuits using the 5V pin to make sure they work.

### Step Two: Write the Code
